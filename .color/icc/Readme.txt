*Canon EOS camera profiles*
This package contains camera profiles for the following cameras:
- Canon EOS 5D MkIII, generated on the 26th of August 2012
- Canon EOS 7D, generated on the 26th of August 2012
- Canon EOS 40D, generated onthe 31st of July 2012
- Canon EOS 500D, generated on the 26th of March 2012
- Canon EOS 350D, generated on the 26th of March 2012





* Ufraw parameters*
These profiles are intended to be used in UFRaw [http://ufraw.sourceforge.net],
although they may work with other raw converters too. Suitable UFRaw
parameters for the 500D, and 350D profiles are as follow:
- Gamma: 0.45
- Linearity: 0.1
- Output intent: saturation

Suitable parameters for the 5D MkIII 7D, and 40D profiles are as follow:
- Gamma: 1
- Linearity: 0
- Output intent: saturation

Each camera requires a proper (output) curve to be defined: design your own
depending on your preferences.





*Technical Notes*
The profiles for Canon 5D MkIII and 7D have been generated by using a Xrite Colorchecker
Passport shot in sunlight and the following parameters for ArgyllCMS colprof:
-qu -y -am -u -bn -nc

The profiles for Canon 40D have been generated by using a Coloraid
[http://www.targets.coloraid.de] IT8 target shot with flash light
and the following parameters for ArgyllCMS colprof:
-v -qu -y -ax -u -bn -nc 


The profiles for Canon 500D and Canon 350D have been generated by using a Coloraid
[http://www.targets.coloraid.de] IT8 target shot in sunlight and the following
parameters for ArgyllCMS colprof:

tutorial on camera profile generation and who also provides some camera
profiles himself.

A big thank you to Antonio Taddeo who provided the Canon 500D for shooting the
target.
